# hierarchy

This is a create-read-update-delete website element that allows for pages (page title / text) to be created in a hierarchical pattern. It uses various recursive functions to generate the navigation links.

To get this Php/Mysql project working:

  - Download the files into a folder on your Apache web server.
  - Import the database and contents of the tables with the sql/db_export.sql file.
  - Edit the file classes/dbConn.php and change.
  - You will need to change the permissions of the hierarchy.json file to allow php to write to it.

 The project comes with example pages already inserted.
